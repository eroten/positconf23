## 

In my workplace, we started off with a tiny data science team. 

<!-- need *time*, place, and characters -->
. . .


And by tiny I mean 2 people. 

. . . 

we managed to expand our team, and teach more folks about R.

. . . 

when we got more data scientists on board, 

. . .

it became clear that we were all **_very_** used to working alone with a single incident. 

. . . 

## ...how bad was this incident?

I maintain an R package for folks in my workplace.

It has all sorts of practical things, like color codes, ggplot2 themes, and database helpers. 

<!-- This isn't exactly ideal for building a functional team -->


<!-- I don't think this story is particularly unique -->
<!-- we all make mistakes that break other peoples' code -->
- with shared projects
-

this talk is not about being a manager or how to manage a data science team, 

but how to be a good colleague when someone new comes in

## 

<!-- Work is work, and what makes it enjoyable, more than the subject matter, is the *people* you get work with and the team you create.  -->

Your manager will accomplish lots of important things for bringing in a new person - but you are the person they get to work with day-to-day!



## 

1. Make the implicit explicit
1. All knowledge is valid and valuable
1. Document (aka, make life easier for your friends)

# Make the implicit explicit {background-color="#A1B4B9"}



## Workplace culture {background-color="#A1B4B9"}


## {background-color="#A1B4B9"}

don't
- Everyone thinks that they don't have culture, but really, its what we are all surrounded with constantly.
- Start by making a list of the tools you use on a daily basis, no matter how big or small
<!-- go through how you use them, and to what extent -->
<!-- how do they make your life easier? -->
- I recommend using a Git GUI (like GitKraken)
<!-- - A git GUI is a great way to visualize branches and track progress over time. -->
<!-- It also  -->




# All knowledge is valuable {background-color="#D9CBBF"}

## {background-color="#D9CBBF"}


they have certain skill your team may have been lacking

Data science is a deeply creative field. You can hand two different people a challenging problem and they both can come up with totally different ways of solving it

all the knowledge that the new person is bringing in 

There is a lot of work that your manager will take care of...

the recipe for trust 


##  {background-color="#D9CBBF"}

- Patience will prove best
<!-- your manager will do a lot of the legwork to get this person onboard,  -->
<!-- like setting up timesheets and going through workplace policies -->
<!-- but you are still the person they will be actually working with -->
<!-- you will have to bring this person up to speed, and that is part of it -->
- You(r manager) hired this person for a reason
-
# Document {background-color="#E3C0B6"}


## A matter of investment {background-color="#E3C0B6"}


- **Invest** in tools that encourage documentation and lower cognitive load.
- **Invest** in the time it takes to document/clean up/organize your work
- **Invest** in strong social relationships

<!-- do things that don't feel like work -->
<!-- - Try making every other team meeting a casual hang-out -->
- Schedule in time to build connections and trust. These social gatherings are just as valuable as focus time


<!-- Even if your new colleague says they have experience with git, that could mean very different things.  -->


# Ultimately...

## 

I've grown immensely from working with my colleagues

Investing in your team not just as a manger, but as a coworker
