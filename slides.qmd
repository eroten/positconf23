## 

In my workplace, we started off with a small data science team. 

This started when 

when we got more data scientists on board, it became clear that we were all accustomed to working aloe


## 

1. All knowledge is valid
2. Make the implicit explicit
3. Documentation

# All knowledge is valid {background-color="#D9CBBF"}

## {background-color="#D9CBBF"}

<!-- Data science is a deeply creative field -->


- Patience will prove best
- You hired this person for a reason
- Diversity 

# Make the implicit explicit {background-color="#A1B4B9"}

## Workplace culture {background-color="#A1B4B9"}

## {background-color="#A1B4B9"}

- Everyone thinks that they don't have culture, but really, its what we are all surrounded with constantly.
- Start by making a list of the tools you use on a daily basis, no matter how big or small


# Document {background-color="#E3C0B6"}


## A matter of investment {background-color="#E3C0B6"}


- **Invest** in tools that encourage documentation and lower cognitive load.
<!-- - A git GUI is a great way to visualize branches and track progress over time. -->

- **Invest** in the time it takes to document/clean up/organize your work
- **Invest** in strong social relationships

<!-- - Try making every other team meeting a casual hang-out -->
<!-- - Schedule in time to build connections and trust -->
<!-- - These social gatherings are just as valuable as focus time -->


<!-- Even if your new colleague says they have experience with git, that could mean very different things.  -->


# Ultimately...

## 

I've grown immensely from working with my colleagues

# Thank you
