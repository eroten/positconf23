- Expecting more advanced version of the N:\ drive. Universities have office for data practices, etc. Data storage, archiving, is very important for them
- epxectation that things would be more organized than they actually were.
- (theme, the person coming in has expectations too, and they might not match what they actually get)
- expcteded GitHub, wasn't expecting enterprise tools. the value of having good collaboration tools to invest in and work with is high
- didn't expect a lot of people to work with the tools I work with
- thought there would be archaic, but standard
- lots of personal preferences come throught
  - people use a lot of tools for their owrk
  - central organized method for archiving things

- expecting government to have a more broad focus - academia is more narrow. universities' business is doing research, scientific standards, more rigid
- super frustrating coming back in, visitor survey,
- no standard = impossible to build off past materials
- standards are also cultural, lot of teamwork central, adjacent
- documentation, archiving, hope to be collaborating with yourself in 6 months
- if growth mindset is part of culture, then there are things in workflows that facilitate that
   no stnadards = opportunties to develop things that work better for certain people
  lot of room for people to figure out what works for them, but then you have to collaborate and reach a middle ground

- GitHub, enterprise is helpful, and learning how to use it within an organization
  - valuble time to walk through, or a manual?
  - onboarding someone,
  - examples of problems that have been solved with tools
  - having a pre-manual
  
- Shiny, learned new on the job
- R community is so valuable on an interpresonal level, and larger level

Super helpful was 
- helped live code the first shiny app, didn't know the right questions to ask yet
- seeing, watching someone else do the work and think through things
- get to know


There are parts of your workplace that aren't ideal, and may be shameful => motivation to hide, ignore, but the new person needs to know that!
data practices only work as well as the tools, IS support

Already knew R, 
send me an analysis and walk me through it, and how you did it. 
slightly different on-ramps

there are so many ways to arrive at the same end goal
tools to collaborate, trying to do similar things
individuals end up learning, 
less importatnt that everything is truly reproducible

functions!

lowering barriers
trying to create culture where showing your work is better than not, even if you aren't a master
figure out how to make that okay, learning opporutnity rather than creates barriers

combination of being a point person to ask questions, get answers.
also kind of having a toolbox of things, and examples of how something is done
institutional knowledge of projects, tools behind them, being willing to understand that everyone is learning, aksing questions is a good thing
having a contact point for other people
