## In the beginning... {background-image="img/barbie.png"}

. . . 

We started off with a tiny data science team. 

<!-- need *time*, place, and characters -->
. . .

And by tiny, I mean 2 people. 

<!-- Over time, our team grew.  -->
<!-- More data scientists + R users -->
<!-- but...  -->
<!-- we were all **_very_** used to working alone.  -->
<!-- this became clear with one particular incident -->

# The Incident {background-image="img/barbie_incident.jpeg"}


## ...how bad was the incident?
::: {.fragment .strike}
In the beginning, I wrote an R package for my org.
:::

## ...how bad was the incident?

In the beginning, I wrote an R package for __myself__.

<!-- It has all sorts of practical things, like color codes, ggplot2 themes, and database helpers.  -->

<!-- Of my own accord, I decided that we should use a more flexible font sizing scheme for our ggplot2 theme.  -->
<!-- I was so excited to push this change out and magically make everything better. -->
<!-- I made the changes, released the new version, and encouraged my colleagues to install it.  -->

My colleague installed the update

... while they were writing a time sensitive report.

## What went wrong?

- Inaccurate and inadequate documentation
- Lack of communication
- Mismatched priorities

## Could my manager have prevented this?

. . . 

No



<!-- I don't think this story is particularly unique -->
<!-- we all make mistakes that break other peoples' code -->
<!-- and we are the ones that have to clean up after ourselves -->

## There is an "I" in "Team"
<!-- several I's in fact -->

. . . 

Team: a group of **individuals** working together


<!-- this talk is not about being a manager or how to manage a data science team,  -->

. . .


You can __shape__ your team by 

- caring for your new team members
- seeing how you fit into your team, and
- changing how you work.

<!-- but how to be a good colleague when someone new comes in -->
<!-- it isn't always obvious how you should shift your mindset when your team expands -->
<!-- Work is work, and what makes it enjoyable, more than the subject matter, is the *people* you get work with and the team you create.  -->

<!-- Your manager will accomplish lots of important things for bringing in a new person - but you are the person they get to work with day-to-day! -->

## When you have a new colleague 

Its your responsibility to bring them on board, too!

## Peer onboarding

1. Make the implicit explicit
1. All knowledge is valid and valuable
1. Document (aka, make life easier for your friends)

```

## Don't deny that water exists {background-color=`r section1_color`}
<!-- so, before you turn into an anxious goldfish... -->


- Everyone has their pet peeves and preferences.
<!-- maybe you have a super strict file organization scheme -->
<!-- or you are morally opposed using any tidyverse -->
- Every team has a culture.
- Don't give your new coworker the task of defining water in addition to evaluating if the water is right for them.



## Define your water {background-color=`r section1_color`}

- What does your weekly schedule look like?
- What tools do you use daily? Why?
- What expectations does your work group have around email/message response times?
<!-- - Everyone thinks that they don't have culture, but really, its what we are all surrounded with constantly. -->
<!-- - Start by making a list of the tools you use on a daily basis, no matter how big or small -->
<!-- go through how you use them, and to what extent -->
<!-- how do they make your life easier? -->
<!-- What are the gaps in your toolchain? -->
<!-- - I recommend using a Git GUI (like GitKraken) -->
<!-- - A git GUI is a great way to visualize branches and track progress over time. -->

# All knowledge is valid and valuable {background-color=`r section2_color`}  


## No one is an empty vessel {background-color=`r section2_color`}


<!-- they have certain skill your team may have been lacking -->

All the knowledge the new person brings is valuable.

- No matter where they are coming from
- Even if it seems unrelated

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Your knowledge it is not inherently superior.
:::

<!-- There is a lot of work that your manager will take care of... -->


## Give your new colleague grace {background-color=`r section2_color`}

- Patience will prove best.
- You are on probation, too!
<!-- your manager will do a lot of the legwork to get this person onboard,  -->
<!-- like setting up timesheets and going through workplace policies -->
<!-- but you are still the person they will be actually working with -->
<!-- you will have to bring this person up to speed, and that is part of it -->
- Don't rely on catch-all assumptions: ask for specifics.
<!-- someone with command line git experience versus a GUI will have different needs -->



# Document {background-color=`r section3_color`}

:::

## Documentation is the bowl {background-color=`r section3_color`}

Data science is a creative field: there are many ways to solve a problem .

. . . 

Embrace the diversity of opinion and experience.

. . . 

Just remember to leave a trail for others to follow.

## A matter of investment {background-color=`r section3_color`}

- **Invest** in tools that encourage documentation and lower cognitive load.
- **Invest** in the time it takes to document/clean up/organize your work.
- **Invest** in strong social relationships.

## Documentation == Communication {background-color=`r section3_color`}

Good communication requires knowing your audience!

![](img/conf23-hero2-static.png)


## Work doesn't always feel like work {background-color=`r section3_color`}

<!-- I'll take a wild guess and say that most of you didn't go into a quantitative field because you are naturally effervescent  -->
<!-- do things that don't feel like work -->
- Schedule time to build connections and trust. 
<!-- try making every other team meeting a casual hang out -->
- Social gatherings (virtual or in person!) are just as valuable as focus time.
- Try making every other team meeting a casual hang out.
<!-- virtual social gatherings -->

# Ultimately...

## There is an "I" in "Team"

- Teams are made up of individuals, and its not only the manager's job to make it work.
- Onboarding is a unique and critical time.
- I've grown immensely from working with my colleagues.
<!-- and only a small portion of that is because of my manager -->

<!-- Investing in your team not just as a manger, but as a coworker -->
<!-- and we had to acknowledge that there are individuals in our team -->
