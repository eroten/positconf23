# Interview questions

I will interview my colleagues to get their feedback on onboarding with me/at the Council. Questions below

- What were your expectations for onboarding as a data scientist when you started your role at the Met Council?
- Are there cultural aspects about our data science workflows you wish you knew from the beginning?
- Is there a specific tool or set of tools you wish you had more support in at the beginning?
- What was the most helpful part of onboarding with me?
