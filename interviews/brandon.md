most helpful tool - GitKraken

•	What were your expectations for onboarding as a data scientist when you started your role at the Met Council?
  - had access to all our repos, saw that things were more structured
  - previously, everyone was their own silo. not often actively working on another file with a DS
  - equity - more top down, cut trips and disambiguated by racial demographic, block group
    -  how to separate things out by race, proportionally allocate based on isochrones, take to metrics, push
  -  what tool was least walked through
    - actual work didn't change that much, just the context around it
    - more onboarding with python
•	Are there cultural aspects about our data science workflows you wish you knew from the beginning?
  - Liz is very rigid and structured with git practices, (7-8/10)
  - not sure how many other advanced features
  - Liz is okay with code looking different, as long as its readable vs. wanting everyone's code to look like his code
  - clever code vs. readable code
  - there isn't a defined culture,
  - I could keep coding how I've always coded, and it doens't feel like a rigid structure
  - file naming conventions, was there a super specific thing or set of rules
  - version control and microsoft?? how does that work??
•	Is there a specific tool or set of tools you wish you had more support in at the beginning?
•	What was the most helpful part of onboarding with me?
  - never used git prior to the Council, never used anything other than the command line
  - not just workflow, but also history

General - how many things the previous person was juggling, and how they work together. None are small
- coming into, have 9 projects individually accounted to.
- work one, means that you are taking time away from another thing.
- have to work through it, and it takes time to spin up
- limited ability to make progress on one project. putting out fires,
- had Jonathan give two projects -> do these and get rolling on them, all the way through.
- Feel comfortable and confident in two projects.
- DO start working on a project. Any project, and get into it before you start adding on more
- make sure you have a focused plan on what they are going to do
- really important, to say that there are some things you can't do, and if there aren't any then you have a staffing problem
- let people get up to speed on a few things
- don't give people too much, so they don't have enough time to get
